about=
      dzetsaka is a compact AI for Earth Observation plugin for remote sensing classification in QGIS.

      Built for fast map production and practical operations:
      - 12 production-ready ML classifiers (GMM, RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, ET, GBC, LR, NB, MLP)
      - Optuna hyperparameter optimization
      - SHAP explainability and confidence outputs
      - Class-imbalance workflow (SMOTE, class weights, nested CV)
      - Guided/compact dashboard for rapid results

      2025 trend-aligned focus:
      - AI for Earth Observation and Earth Intelligence workflows
      - Multimodal EO feature pipelines
      - Vision-transformer-ready ecosystem language
      - Trustworthy AI: interpretability, uncertainty awareness, and reproducible validation
