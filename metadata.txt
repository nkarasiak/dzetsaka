about=
      üéØ Powerful classification plugin supporting 11 machine learning algorithms:
      
      CORE: GMM, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
      ADVANCED: XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP
      
      üöÄ NEW: Automatic dependency installation! No more manual pip commands - dzetsaka auto-installs scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM with one click.
      
      ‚ö° Enhanced features: Hyperparameter optimization, sparse label handling, improved error handling, and GitHub issue integration.
      
      Very easy, fast, and powerful to use.
