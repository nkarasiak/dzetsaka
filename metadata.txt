about=
      🎯 Powerful classification plugin supporting 11 machine learning algorithms:
      
      CORE: GMM, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
      ADVANCED: XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP
      
      🚀 NEW: Automatic dependency installation! No more manual pip commands - dzetsaka auto-installs scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM with one click.
      
      ⚡ Enhanced features: Hyperparameter optimization, sparse label handling, improved error handling, and GitHub issue integration.
      
      Very easy, fast, and powerful to use.

changelog=
    4.2.2
      * 🏗️ MAJOR REFACTOR: Modular architecture implementation - split monolithic 1,397-line dzetsaka.py into clean modules
      * 📦 NEW: core/ module with separated concerns - plugin.py, settings_manager.py, ui_controller.py, file_manager.py
      * 🧠 NEW: ml/ module with dedicated learner.py and classifier.py for machine learning operations
      * 🎯 IMPROVED: Single Responsibility Principle - each class now has one clear purpose
      * 🔗 IMPROVED: Reduced coupling between UI, business logic, settings, and ML components
      * 🧪 IMPROVED: Testable design - each component can be tested independently
      * 🔄 MAINTAINED: Full backward compatibility - all existing functionality preserved
      * 📉 REDUCED: Main plugin file complexity from 1,397 to ~100 lines
      * 🔧 UPDATED: Processing algorithms to use new modular ML components
    4.2.0
      * 🎯 NEW: 7 additional machine learning algorithms - XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP
      * 🚀 NEW: Automatic dependency installation system - one-click install of scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
      * ⚡ NEW: Automatic hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation grid search for all algorithms
