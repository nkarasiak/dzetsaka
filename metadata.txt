about=
      🎯 Powerful classification plugin supporting 11 machine learning algorithms:
      
      CORE: GMM, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
      ADVANCED: XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP
      
      🚀 NEW: Automatic dependency installation! No more manual pip commands - dzetsaka auto-installs scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM with one click.
      
      ⚡ Enhanced features: Hyperparameter optimization, sparse label handling, improved error handling, and GitHub issue integration.
      
      Very easy, fast, and powerful to use.

changelog=
    4.3.0
      * FIX: Improved auto-install for Debian/Ubuntu systems where pip module is not available
      * FIX: Auto-install now tries multiple methods: pip module, ensurepip bootstrap, apt via pkexec
      * FIX: Installation failure dialog now shows manual installation commands directly
      * COMPAT: Full QGIS 4.0 forward compatibility - migrated all PyQt5 imports to qgis.PyQt
      * PERF: Vectorized scale() functions - ~60% CPU reduction for data normalization
      * PERF: Vectorized Shannon entropy calculation - ~95% speedup (minutes to seconds)
      * PERF: Vectorized raster band reading with GDAL ReadAsArray() - ~30% I/O improvement
      * PERF: Optimized GMM prediction with NumPy einsum - ~40% CPU reduction
      * PERF: Vectorized geodesic distance matrix computation - ~50% speedup
      * PERF: Replaced repeated array concatenation with pre-allocation - ~30% memory reduction
      * PERF: Replaced if-elif chains with dict lookups for GDAL/NumPy type conversion
      * FIX: Robust layer source path extraction using QgsProviderRegistry (handles GeoPackage, etc.)
      * CODE: Added get_layer_source_path() helper for safe URI parsing
    4.2.0
      * 🎯 NEW: 7 additional machine learning algorithms - XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP

      * ⚡ NEW: Automatic hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation grid search for all algorithms
      * 🔧 NEW: Smart sparse label handling - automatically handles missing class labels (e.g., 0,1,3)
      * 📊 NEW: GitHub issue integration - automatic error reporting templates with system info
      * 🎨 IMPROVED: Better log levels (INFO vs WARNING) and more informative progress messages
      * 🐛 FIX: Resolved parameter delegation issues for XGBoost/LightGBM wrappers
      * 🐛 FIX: Fixed model serialization/pickling for new wrapper classes

      * 📝 ENHANCED: Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types and user guidance
    4.1.0
      * Major code refactoring and optimization of scripts/mainfunction.py
      * Remove Hungarian notation prefixes (in/out) from parameter names with full backward compatibility
      * Significant memory optimizations for large multi-band image processing
      * Enhanced error handling with specific exception types and detailed error messages
      * Added comprehensive type hints and improved documentation
      * Broke down 1279-line method into focused, maintainable helper methods
      * Added configuration constants for better maintainability
      * Created parameter migration guide for smooth transition
