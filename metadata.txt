about=
      🎯 Powerful classification plugin supporting 11 machine learning algorithms:

      CORE: GMM, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
      ADVANCED: XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP

      ⚡ NEW in v4.3.0: Optuna hyperparameter optimization - 2-10x faster training with Bayesian optimization!

      🚀 Features: Auto-install dependencies, intelligent hyperparameter tuning, sparse label handling, improved error handling, and GitHub issue integration.

      Very easy, fast, and powerful to use.
